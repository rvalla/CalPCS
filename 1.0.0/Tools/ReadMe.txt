CalPCS Tools Readme

RandomSetAnalysis is a terminal program to generate aleatory pitch class set, either for
extended CalPCS testing or get a certain number of pitch class sets.
SetMultiplier is a terminal program to multiply a set by 5, 7 and 11 to obtain three new
sets. Remember that the result of multiplying by 5 and 7 are inversion-related, and of
multiplying by 11 is inversion-related to original set (multiplied by 1).
